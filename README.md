# Genomic-Comparison-and-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Genes-Detection
he primary aim of this project is to perform a comparative genomic analysis between two bacterial strains to identify and characterize antimicrobial resistance genes. By leveraging genome annotation data from RAST, the project seeks to pinpoint differences and commonalities in ARG profiles.
